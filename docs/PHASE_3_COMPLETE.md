## 🔗 Integration Points

### Navigation Flow
```
Dashboard → Savings (tab navigation)
Dashboard → TopUp (modal)
Savings → TopUp (modal with pre-selected type)
TopUp → Back to previous screen (success)
```

### State Management Flow
```
1. User opens Dashboard
   → fetchDashboardData() called
   → Loads balance + recent 5 transactions
   → Calculates monthly stats

2. User navigates to Savings
   → fetchBalance() and fetchTransactions() called
   → Loads all transactions with pagination

3. User selects savings type tab
   → Filters transactions by type
   → Updates selected balance display

4. User taps Top Up
   → Opens TopUp modal
   → Pre-selects savings type (if from Savings screen)

5. User completes top-up
   → Calls topUp() service
   → Updates balance in store
   → Navigates back with success message
```

### Data Flow

## 📝 Notes

1. **Payment Integration**: The TopUp screen has placeholders for payment gateway integration. In production, this would integrate with actual payment providers (Midtrans, Xendit, etc.).

2. **Supabase Schema**: Ensure the following tables exist:
   - `user_balances` (id, user_id, pokok, wajib, sukarela, total, updated_at)
   - `transactions` (id, user_id, type, savings_type, amount, balance, description, status, reference_id, created_at)

3. **Error Handling**: All services include comprehensive error handling. Consider implementing a centralized error tracking service (Sentry, etc.) in production.

4. **Performance**: Transaction lists use FlatList with pagination for optimal performance with large datasets.

5. **Type Safety**: All components, stores, and services are fully typed with TypeScript for better developer experience and fewer runtime errors.
