# app.config.js Removal - Fix Summary

## Issue

When running `eas build`, the command failed with:
```
Warning: Your project uses dynamic app configuration, and the EAS project ID can't automatically be added to it.
Cannot automatically write to dynamic config at: app.config.ts
```

## Root Cause

1. We created `app.config.js` earlier to help expose the projectId
2. EAS detected dynamic configuration and expected `app.config.ts` (TypeScript)
3. EAS couldn't automatically write to the dynamic config file
4. The projectId was already correctly configured in `app.json`, so the dynamic config wasn't needed

## Solution

**Removed `app.config.js`** to let EAS use `app.json` directly.

### Why This Works

The projectId is already properly configured in `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "extra": {
      "eas": {
        "projectId": "06863a61-aa5a-4f34-b0e8-7be02c7514eb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

EAS will read this directly from `app.json` without needing a dynamic config file.

## Current Configuration

### Files Present ✅
- `app.json` - Static configuration with projectId
- `eas.json` - Build profiles configuration

### Files Removed ❌
- `app.config.js` - Removed (caused dynamic config warning)
- `app.config.ts` - Never existed (EAS was looking for it)

## Next Steps

You can now run the build command successfully:

```bash
eas build --profile production --platform all
```

The build should:
1. ✅ Detect the project ID from app.json
2. ✅ Link the project automatically
3. ✅ Start building for Android and iOS
4. ✅ Complete in 15-25 minutes

## What Changed

**Before:**
```
Project structure:
├── app.json (with projectId in extra.eas)
├── app.config.js (dynamic config)
└── eas.json

Result: EAS confused by dynamic config
```

**After:**
```
Project structure:
├── app.json (with projectId in extra.eas) ✅
└── eas.json ✅

Result: EAS reads app.json directly
```

## Verification

To verify the configuration is correct:

```bash
# Check projectId in app.json
grep -A 3 '"eas"' app.json

# Should output:
# "eas": {
#   "projectId": "06863a61-aa5a-4f34-b0e8-7be02c7514eb"
# }

# Verify no app.config.js exists
ls app.config.* 2>/dev/null

# Should output nothing (file doesn't exist)
```

## Build Command

```bash
eas build --profile production --platform all
```

Expected behavior:
- Reads projectId from app.json ✅
- Links project automatically ✅
- Starts build process ✅

---

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - app.config.js removed
**Configuration**: ✅ app.json only (static config)
**Ready for build**: ✅ Yes
